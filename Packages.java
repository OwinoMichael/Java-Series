/**             PACKAGES
 *      These are just the file and folder structures in Java
 *      There are some inbuilt classes & interfaces in Java which are stored in unique packages (files and folders)
 *      In order to access the Classes e.g. ArrayList, we import the package
 *      " package java.util.ArrayList " we are accessing inbuilt class called ArrayList in Java/Utils/ArrayList.java
 *
 *      When building projects/Libraries, we also create our own packages
 *      E.g. A package for Google would be "com.google.maps" to access their map library
 *      Reversing the domain name makes it UNIQUE
 *      We should also make our own libraries unique com.owino.encodeJava
